This file contains multiple parts in an assembly. When you open the file it should have everything where it needs to be so you can design around it. I scanned my personal '88 CZ-82 so there may be differences between frames because of tooling differences between batches. Created in Solid Edge 2021. Confirmed working in FreeCAD.

This file contains multiple parts in an assembly. When you open the file it should have everything where it needs to be so you can design around it. It was built using calipers and physical measurements from an 'x' marked magazine along with a few infered design elements and interpreted designer intent. Created in Solid Edge 2021. Confirmed working in FreeCAD.
