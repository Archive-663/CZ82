This file contains multiple parts in an assembly. When you open the file it should have everything where it needs to be so you can design around it. I scanned my personal '88 CZ-82 so there may be differences between frames because of tooling differences between batches. Created in Solid Edge 2021. Confirmed working in FreeCAD.
