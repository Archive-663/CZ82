A collection of holsters for the CZ-82 and CZ-83 (w/o square trigger guard)

### Features:
- Ambidextrous belt mount
- 15mm bushing spacing for most claw attachments

### Printing suggestion:
- ABS filament would be the best balance in ease of printing and durability. Not as resistant to solvents as PETG but better impact resistance and elongation before breakage. Better heat and UV resistance than PLA.
- Follow the printOrientationFile.3mf for print orientation. If importing to CURA you can simply import the models and then slice with your settings. In PrusaSlicer it does not carry the information over well from CURA.

### Post Processing:
- You will need to <a href="https://www.cnckitchen.com/blog/testing-the-strength-of-3d-prints-re-melted-in-salt" target="_blank">salt re-flow</a> your prints for maximum strength. Either that or simply weld the layers with a soldering iron where your mounting points are. You will have to drill out holes to fit your mounting hardware and your cant angle.
