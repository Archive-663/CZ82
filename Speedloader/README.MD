# CZ-82 9x18mm Speedloader/unloader

![CZ-82 Speedloader](https://github.com/Archive-663/CZ82/blob/main/ASSETS/PHOTO/GMP01553.jpg)

An optimized speedloader and unloader for CZ-82 & CZ-83 magazines

### Features:
- Ambidextrous unloading tabs
- Replaceable plunger
- Compact size

### Printing suggestion:
- ABS filament would be the best balance in ease of printing and durability. Not as resistant to solvents as PETG but better impact resistance and elongation before breakage. Better heat and UV resistance than PLA.
- Follow the printOrientationFile.3mf for print orientation. If importing to CURA you can simply import the models and then slice with your settings. In PrusaSlicer it does not carry the information over well from CURA.

### Post Processing:
- You may need to file the dovetail for the plunger to fit snuggly. If your support settings are setup well, there shouldn't be much more in post than the filing.
