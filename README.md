### Background Story:
I wanted to carry my CZ-82 with a light, but there weren't any options for me to make this happen. Four years ago I started 3D printing and designing in CAD for photography related things. About two years ago I tried to design a NATO grip for the 82 but didn't like the accuracy of the design as well as the fit. Earlier this year I picked up a 3D scanner that allowed me to better design a fitted NATO grip by helping me reverse engineer the frame and slide. The included CZ82 Frame Assembly STEP file is my best approximation at what CZ designer were thinking back in the 80's. With time and tooling wear through batches there may be some inconsistencies in my file, but it's a good starting point to fit your own grips on your 82/83.

It was a frustratingly hard thing to wrap my head around. It took me about four start ups to finally start understanding how I should be thinking when reverse engineering a made product. There was a lot of guessing at what the 'designer intent' was when making measurements and curves. It was a good learning experience and I believe the finished file is a very good digital approximation of the CZ-82 frame.
