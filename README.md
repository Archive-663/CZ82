![samplePhoto001](https://github.com/Archive-663/CZ82/blob/main/ASSETS/PHOTO/GMP01538.jpg)

### In this repository:
- NATO compatible rail grips
- Standard grips
- Slim grips
- Holsters for each setup
- Speedloader/unloader

### What you'll need:
- 2x m2 x 14mm hex cap screw
- 1x m2 x 10mm hex cap screw
- 1x m2 x 8mm hex cap screw
- 2x slim m3.5 x 8mm screw (or slim CZ75 grip screws)
- m2 drill bit
- m3.5 drill bit

### Printing help:
I'd recommend PA6-GF from Polymaker under PolyMide line for the NATO grips. I'm okay with ABS as well as they held up okay during the range test.

### Post Processings:
There's not much to do is printed correctly, but if you want to dye the Grey PA6-GF you can dye into darker colors with RIT Dye. I chose black but I believe you can get a dark green using a green dye. 

### Assembly help:
Coming Soon

### Help support Archive 663 with a dontation or monthly sub
